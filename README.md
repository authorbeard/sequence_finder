# sequence_finder

A first attempt at finding a foolproof way of finding and counting all occurrences of a sequence in a string, including nonadjacent cases. Works for query strings up to 4 characters long at present. Notes.md contains a chart of all the occurences of 'abcd' in a longer string. 

To test-drive, simply fork and clone to your machine, go into irb, type: load 'sequence_finder.rb', then try it out with a couple of sequences.
